#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methoda and tools in the maintenance of software systems. It involves designing,development, testing and deployment and maintainance of software products. The role of software engineering is crucial espesically now, in the digital era, to enable human all over the world to connect and also solve some of the world's pressing challenges

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Development of programming languages in the 1960s to support the software systems of the digital computers which were developed in the 1940s- 1950s. This languages ( Fortan and C etc) led to the establishment of Software Engineering as a discpline. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s which supported the design and development of softwares and rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s, focusing on iteration, testing and responding to changes.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methdology is sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) while Agile methodologies are more iterative and flexible and adaptive based on the context.

For Example, for Waterfall methodology you first design and develop the product then launch it to the market, for the agile methodology, it is iteratuve, one might be at the design stage and still out concepts/ ideas with different stakeholders this will ensure the product developed meet the needs of the different stakeholders and also co-create with them throughout the process 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.Prompt engineering helps in making one's questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about bananas
Improve Prompt: Tell me more about the nutritional difference between green and yellow bananas
